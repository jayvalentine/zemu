# zemu

## Introduction

Zemu is a configurable Z80 emulator, mainly intended for integration into build and test suites.
However, it can also be used as an interactive emulator from the command-line.

## New in v0.3.9

### Fixed bug in serial delay functionality

A bug which caused the `serial_delay` parameter to not be interpreted has now been resolved.

## Usage

Configurations can be defined in a declarative syntax, from which
an emulator executable can be compiled. This executable can then be run
from within Zemu and controlled programmatically.

```ruby
require 'zemu'

# A simple configuration with a ROM block
# and a RAM block.
conf = Zemu::Config.new do
    name "zemu_emulator"

    add_memory Zemu::Config::ROM.new do
        name "rom"
        address 0x0000
        size 0x4000

        contents from_binary("app.bin")
    end

    add_memory Zemu::Config::RAM.new do
        name "ram"
        address 0x8000
        size 0x1000
    end
end

# Start a new instance with this configuration.
instance = Zemu.start(conf)

# Program breakpoint.
# Will trigger if the emulator is about to execute an
# instruction at 0x102.
instance.break 0x102, :program

# Continue. Emulator will run until HALT or until
# the breakpoint (set above) is hit.
instance.continue

# Display the value of the A register (accumulator)
# at the breakpoint.
puts instance.register["A"]

# Close the instance.
instance.quit
```

An interactive mode is also provided, which gives a command-line interface to the emulated
machine.

## Documentation

Where possible, code examples have been given to show how the various configuration options can be used.
In addition, API documentation should be complete enough to indicate how to construct a configuration.

If this is not the case, please let me know!

Documentation for the gem can be found [here](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/zemu).

## Compatibility

Zemu has currently only been tested with one OS (Linux) and one compiler (clang), so compatibility with
other environments is not guaranteed. Please raise an issue if you encounter an issue, giving the details
of your environment, so that it can be resolved!
